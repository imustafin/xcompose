.XCompose
=========

This repo contains a large set of X11 Compose key sequences.

More contributions are welcome; please make a pull request at
<http://github.org/strake/xcompose> or send a patch to <strake888@gmail.com>.
We seek a broadly acceptable set of keybindings which won't interfere with the
traditional Compose bindings, aren't too hard to type, and cover a wide set of
occasionally-useful characters, making them available sans specialized input
methods.

After installing `.XCompose` you will need to restart any applications
to see its effect for that application. Not all applications support
XCompose, and it depends on which input method you are using.

Some "extensions" have been added to this repository, and installing them
may take a few more commands.  Use `make` to generate the extension files
(for emoji, modifier letters, etc.)  You can include them by using the
`include` directive in your `.XCompose` file.  So you might actually not
want to use our `install` script, but rather create your own `.XCompose`
(perhaps with your own personal entries) along these lines:

	include "/path/to/dotXCompose"
	include "/path/to/frakturcompose"
	include "/path/to/emoji.compose"
	include "/path/to/modletters.compose"
	include "/path/to/parens.compose"

	# I complain a lot, oy...
	<Multi_key> <O> <Y>	: "ัน" U0479	# CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER UK
	# My very original smileyface!
	<Multi_key> <parenleft> <t> <u> <parenright> : "ใก" U32E1 # CIRCLED KATAKANA TU
	# ...
